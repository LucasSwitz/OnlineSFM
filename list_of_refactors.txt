1. Have Reconstruction extend ReconstructionAgent
2. Check if a focal profile is known before attempting to do anything with an image.
5. right now we are uploading all images aynchronously, 
                        we could instead upload in bulk via a stream, 
                        using one connection to the gateway and spawn asyncronous requests for reconstruction.
                        Will need a thread pool to handle each image. 
8. Should look into downsampling images
9. add retries for all connectors
